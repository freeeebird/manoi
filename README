Kyosho Manoi (AT-01) Control Software
--------------------------------------

This software can be used to control the Kyosho Manoi Robot [1].
Manoi known under the type AT-01 is originally based on the KHR-2HV kit from Kondo and contains
two embedded controllers. The first one is the RCB which controls the Servo motors directly and the
KCB which is an optional extension board. This control software, originally written by Krystof Kin,
is used to control the RCB controller directly via Serial interface without the use of
``Heart2Heart'' the standard GUI software.
